Labs from COSC 102: Intro to Computer Science at UTK

- Lab 1 - Taking in input to print out name, street address, difference in property value, and estimated monthly mortgage. 

- Lab 2 - After receiving an integer input, identify whether the interstate is a primary or auxiliary highway along with which direction the primary highway runs using a series of if-else statements. Prints error if given input does not pass certain requirements. Program continues to run until the user inputs 0 and will ask the user again for input when inputted a non-integer input.

- Lab 3 - Manage the user's coins, determine if the user won on the "slot machine", add and subtract the appropriate amounts of coins, and run continously until the user has run out of coins or no longer wants to bet. The program checks the user's input every time for non-integer values. The program also prints a summary of all bets and transactions.

- Lab 4 - Utilize stringstream to print out the string the user inputs, count the number of characters, and print the input without whitespace.

- Lab 5 - The shopping cart simulator program stores, manipulates, and prints items with names, descriptions, prices, and quantity.
		   It continually asks the user to choose from a variety of actions:
			-Add item
			-Delete item
			-Change item quantity
			-Print all item descriptions in shopping cart
			-Print all item costs and total cost in shopping cart
			-Quit
			Entering Ctrl-D or 'q' will exit the program.

- Lab 6 - Create a vector class manually using points and dynamic memory
